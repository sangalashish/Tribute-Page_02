      <h2><u>Early Life and Influences: </u></h2>
      <p>Bhagat Singh grew up in a family that valued education and patriotism. His father, Sardar Kishan Singh, was a freedom fighter himself, which deeply influenced young Bhagat Singh's political consciousness. He was greatly inspired by the ideas of nationalistic leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak. Bhagat Singh actively participated in various activities during his school days and later became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later transformed into the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).</p>
      
      <h2><u>Revolutionary Actions: </u></h2>
      <p>Bhagat Singh's commitment to the struggle for independence was reflected in his daring actions. He sought to awaken the masses and expose the oppressive nature of British colonial rule. One of the most significant incidents associated with him was the Lahore Conspiracy Case of 1929, where Bhagat Singh and his comrades sought to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, who had been brutally beaten during a protest against the Simon Commission.</p>
      <p>In an act of protest, Bhagat Singh and his associates threw bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and courted arrest. He, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, willingly accepted responsibility for the incident and delivered a powerful statement during the trial, outlining his vision for a free and just India. Despite their brave acts, Bhagat Singh and his comrades were convicted and eventually executed on March 23, 1931.</p>

      <h2><u>Legacy and Ideology: </u></h2>

His writings, such as "Why I am an Atheist" and "The Philosophy of the Bomb," reflect his progressive and egalitarian worldview. Bhagat Singh envisioned an independent India free from exploitation, where every individual would have equal rights and opportunities.</p>
